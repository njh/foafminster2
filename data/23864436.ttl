   rdfs:comment "Sarah Wollaston (born 17 February 1962) is a British general practitioner and politician who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Totnes for the Conservative party since 2010. She is notable for having been selected as a candidate to follow the retiring MP Anthony Steen through an 'open primary' in which the Conservative Party posted ballot papers to every voter in the constituency. She has portrayed herself as a politician who has worked a \"real job\", and has campaigned for restrictions on alcohol sales to combat alcohol-related crime.";
