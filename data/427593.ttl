   rdfs:comment """David Anthony Laws (born 30 November 1965) is the Minister of State for Schools and the Cabinet Office, where he has a cross-department role working on the Coalition Agreement and government policy. He is also Liberal Democrat Member of Parliament for Yeovil.
Laws was briefly a Cabinet Minister in 2010, as Chief Secretary to the Treasury. He held office for 17 days before resigning due to the disclosure of his Parliamentary expenses claims, described by the Parliamentary Standards and Privileges Committee as "a series of serious breaches of the rules, over a considerable period of time". In consequence of the breaches he was suspended from Parliament by vote of the House of Commons.""";
