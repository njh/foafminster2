   rdfs:comment "Stephen Rothwell O'Brien (born 1 April 1957) is a Conservative Party politician in the United Kingdom. He is Member of Parliament (MP) for Eddisbury, and was first elected in a by-election in July 1999, after Alastair Goodlad was made High Commissioner for Australia by Tony Blair and thus had to leave Parliament. Within the Conservative-Liberal Democrat Coalition, he has been appointed as the Parliamentary Undersecretary of State in the Department for International Development.";
