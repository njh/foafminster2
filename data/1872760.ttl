   rdfs:comment """John Douglas Wilson Carswell (born 3 May 1971) is a British Conservative Party politician. He is the Member of Parliament (MP) for Clacton, having been first elected as MP for Harwich in 2005.
He found prominence by calling for reform of parliamentary expenses before the 2009 expenses scandal, and leading the campaign to eject Michael Martin as Speaker of the House of Commons. A Eurosceptic and libertarian, Carswell is a strong advocate of greater localism, and has worked with Daniel Hannan to promote their 'localist agenda' in the Conservative Party.""";
