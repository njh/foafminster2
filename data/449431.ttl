   rdfs:comment """Frank Roy (born 29 August 1958) is a British Labour Party politician, who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Motherwell and Wishaw since 1997. He was a Government Whip and Lord Commissioner of HM Treasury from 2006 to 2010, after having served as an Assistant Whip from 2005.
Roy was, like many others in the area, a steelworker until he was made redundant in 1991 when Ravenscraig Steelworks closed.[citation needed] He worked as a parliamentary assistant to Helen Liddell MP before becoming MP for Motherwell and Wishaw.[citation needed] He is the first MP born locally to represent Motherwell and Wishaw.[citation needed]""";
