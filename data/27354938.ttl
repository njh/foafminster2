   rdfs:comment """Jonathan Neil Reynolds (28 August 1980) is a British Labour Co-operative politician, who has been the Member of Parliament (MP) for Stalybridge and Hyde since 2010.
Jonathan also served on Labour's National Executive Committee from 2003 to 2005 and until 2011 remained a councillor for Longdendale ward on Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, having been elected in 2007.
Jonathan worked for four years as an aide for the previous Stalybridge and Hyde MP James Purnell and was selected to replace Purnell after a controversial selection process. Aged 29 when first elected, Reynolds was one of the youngest MPs elected at the 2010 election.""";
