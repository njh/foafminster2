   rdfs:comment """Ian Cameron Swales (5 April 1953) is a British Liberal Democrat politician. He is the Member of Parliament for the constituency of Redcar in England from May 2010. Swales took Redcar from Labour incumbent Vera Baird for the Liberal Democrats in the 2010 general election, with a 21.8% swing. Swales added over 10,000 votes to his 2005 general election total. This was the biggest swing against any Labour candidate in the election and also the biggest gain by any Liberal Democrat.
Swales was educated at Ashville College, Harrogate before graduating in chemical engineering from the UMIST. He worked for Imperial Chemical Industries from 1978 to 1999.""";
