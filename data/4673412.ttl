   rdfs:comment """Mary Theresa Glindon (born 13 January 1957) is a British Labour Party politician, who has been the Member of Parliament for North Tyneside since 2010.
Glindon was selected in February 2010 as Labour candidate for the safe seat after the previous MP Stephen Byers announced in November 2009 that he would not contest the next election, having previously been a Councillor on North Tyneside Council, representing the Battle Hill Ward in Wallsend.
At the general election in May 2010, she held the seat with 50.7% of the votes.""";
